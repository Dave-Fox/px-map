    Relative paths assume component is being run from inside an app or another component, where dependencies are flat

Creates a symbol marker that can be attached to the map.

The marker can be used to show a point-of-interest or represent a physical asset.
It can be configured to show an asset's state (through color or badge) and updated
when the asset's state changes.

Place a popup inside the `px-map-marker-symbol` to show data about the point
to the user when they tap, hover over, or interact with the marker.

Interactions with the marker will trigger events (documented on the component's
API page). Attach a listener to the marker or its parent component(s) to trigger
view changes that show additional data about the point elsewhere in your app.

### Usage

Use this component inside of a `px-map` element, or inside of a `px-map-overlay-layer`
element to group it with other geospatial visualizations.

Enable the `fit-to-markers` attribute on the parent `px-map` element to automatically
fit this marker and any other markers drawn within the visual boundaries of the
map when it is first loaded.

For example, the following map will show a single marker within an overlay
layer and automatically fit the marker in the view when the map is loaded.

    <px-map zoom="15" fit-to-markers>
      <px-map-overlay-layer name="Landmarks">
        <px-map-symbol-icon lat="35.6654861" lon="139.7706668">
          <slot name="title">Tsukiji Market</slot>
        </px-map-symbol-icon>
      </px-map-overlay-layer>
    </px-map>
